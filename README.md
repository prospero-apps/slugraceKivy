# slugrace

A 2D game made with Python and Kivy. It can be played by up to four players who place bets on four slugs. The slugs are not just any ordinary slugs, though. These are racing slugs. When you launch the game, you can see the Settings screen where you can set the number of players (1-4), the players' names and initial money (so how much money each player should start with). You can aslo set the ending conditions. The game may be over when there is only one player with any money left, after a specific number of races or after a specified amount of time has elapsed.

Before a race begins, each player places a bet on one of four racing slugs using the text inputs or sliders. On the racetrack you can see the names of the slugs, their win counts and their odds. In the upper part of the screen, you can see some statistics, like the number of the race, the slugs' win counts and the players' stats (how much money they still have). The odds and the statistics are updated accordingly after each race. When a race starts, you can see the slugs move from left to right (toward the finish line). The slugs are animated and usually they just run moving their tentacles, but sometimes accidents happen to them. We also have the option to end the game at any time, mute or unmute the sound and view the instructions. The buttons to do that are in the upper right corner of the screen.

Each player either wins or loses their money. When a race finishes, you can see the winning slug on the right. You can also hear the slug's sound of joy as they cross the finish line and reach for victory. In the Results panel below, you can view the exact results, so how much money each player had before the race, how much they bet and on which slug, whether they won or lost and how much, how much money they still have and what their selected slug's odds were. You can press the Next Race button to continue.

Accidents happen. For example, a slug may break his leg. We mustn't forget that a slug essentially consists of just a leg, to which tentacles are attached.

Sometimes they run so fast that they overheat and burn.

And there are a couple other things that may happen to the slugs. They are all visualized in the game and accompanied by appropriate sound effects.
